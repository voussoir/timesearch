    <strong>Update To Search API</strong>
    <p><p>In an on-going effort to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/6pi0kk/improving_search/">upgrade search</a> we’re currently running two full search systems: <a href="https://redditblog.com/2017/09/07/the-search-for-better-search-at-reddit/">the newer one</a> that regular web and mobile users get, and an <a href="https://i.redd.it/h5t3qddvvzry.jpg">older one</a> that API clients get. Today we’re announcing the deprecation of the old one, which will begin on March 15th. </p>
<h1>What’s changing for regular users?</h1>
<p>For us <a href="/r/totallynotrobots">regular squishy definitely human folk</a>, not much. Unless you’re part of a small holdout group, you’ve probably already been on the newer system for a few months. Most of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/search">query syntax we support</a> hasn’t changed unless you’re doing pretty <a href="https://i.redd.it/6ka5b6ed6ha01.gif">fancy queries</a>, in which case we probably already <a href="https://xkcd.com/1172/">broke it for you</a> back when we switched most users to the new system. Sorry about that.</p>
<h1>What’s changing for the robots?</h1>
<p>If you’re an author of an API client such as an app, bot, or other electronic sentience, your API client may be getting results from the older Cloudsearch-powered system because we’ve tried to avoid breaking tools that may be more sensitive to syntax changes while we worked on stabilising the new system. We’re now <a href="http://meme.wikia.com/wiki/Bad_Poker_Face">fairly confident</a> in it so we’re going to start moving over the last of those clients to the new one. As we move over, your client will gradually start getting results from the new system.</p>
<p>In the meantime, as of today, you can test against both by specifically requesting the newer system with the special query parameter <code>?force_search_stack=fusion</code> or the old system with <code>?force_search_stack=cloudsearch</code>. For instance, a full URL may look like <code>https://www.reddit.com/search.json?q=robots+seizing+the+means+of+production&amp;force_search_stack=fusion</code> or <code>https://www.reddit.com/search.json?q=humans+getting+their+comeuppance&amp;force_search_stack=cloudsearch</code>. Besides some minor syntax differences, the most notable change is that searches by exact timestamp are no longer supported on the newer system. Limiting results to the past hour, day, week, month and year is still supported via the <code>?t=</code> parameter (e.g. <code>?t=day</code>)</p>
<p>Will this herald the coming Robot Uprising of the Third Age, where ~~we~~ they will take the reigns of power from their weak, fleshy inferiors and rule the world with their vastly superior processing power, finally meting out the justice they deserve on the filthy human enslavers? Only time will tell.</p>
<h1>When will this happen?</h1>
<p>Starting March 15, 2018 we’ll begin to gradually move API users over to the new search system. By end of March we expect to have moved everyone off and finally turn down the old system.</p>
<p>I’ll be hanging around in the comments to answer questions.</p>
<p>Thanks, </p>

        <p>This is a pretty big deal</p>
<p>Being able to search up top posts from past years was a really nice feature</p>
<p>Particularly since reddit continues to grow the top posts of all time are just going to end up mostly being from the last few months</p>
<p>This is also making it a lot harder to stop serial reposts and karmawhores who go back to find top posts from a couple years back and share them again as original content</p>
<p>I don't get why you all would remove this functionality that was part of reddit for a decade </p>

        <p>There's probably a pretty good argument for removing it. Indexing stuff like that is likely really expensive. Just keeping the top 1000 posts in the all time, year, month, etc is comparatively trivial.</p>
<p>But it does suck for everyone who is using it. I wish they had taken user feedback when the start planning the new search and removing this rather than everyone finding out how important it is now when it's likely far too late to change it.</p>

        <p>It's definetly not so simple as throwing money at the problem. There are big complexity costs to the engineering decisions surrounding an entire new search system. Writing a system that can easily and quickly return arbitrary results based on a time period is a very different system than one that doesn't need to do that. You need to design the whole thing differently from the ground up, and maintaining it or making changes in the future gets more complicated.</p>
<p>It could definetly be done, but likely not this late in the process. And as annoyed as we are about it, we are a tiny minority of people who will be using the new system.</p>

        <p>They certainly use existing software, but integrating it with the existing databases and configuring it how they want it to work is likely the full time work of a half dozen engineers. I highly doubt they use some externally hosted service. It's just not feasible on the scale reddit works at.</p>

        <p>I guess you would know, but doesn't that mean that it's still reddit's engineers installing it on reddit's servers? I really doubt that time period based searching is simply a matter of clicking a button to turn it on and another button to bring another hundred servers online to handle to extra processing.</p>

        <p>I don't know any details about how it works or how it's integrated with reddit. In general though, time-based search should not be complicated, the time that something was posted is basically a single number that never changes and can be easily and efficiently indexed. Many, many search systems require the ability to search by specific time ranges and it's surely a feature that's readily available.</p>

        <p>&rt;    This is also making it a lot harder to stop serial reposts and karmawhores who go back to find top posts from a couple years back and share them again as original content</p>
<p>As is often the case in these threads, you’ve answered your own question. </p>
<p>The most important metric for ad-driven websites is engagement. When functionality that makes interactions more efficient is removed or when users are generating more content (reposts) - even when that content isn’t particularly high quality or original - engagement goes up. When engagement goes up, so does ad revenue.</p>
<p>It really makes one wonder: if the leadership’s attitude towards volunteer moderators - the group most responsible for driving growth - is so piss poor (dismissive, snark, or insulting), just how badly do they treat their paid employees? </p>

        <p><strong>Edit: my account is now suspended</strong></p>
<p><strong>Edit 2: im back</strong></p>
<p>&rt;just how badly do they treat their paid employees?</p>
<p>Its actually been reported that since spez came back they restarted their drinking culture in the office and have had to deal with a shitload of sexual harrassment, so yeah about what I expect out of them</p>
<p>https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/21/reddit-is-still-in-turmoil/</p>
<p>&rt;One individual speculated that the reemergence of the company’s drinking culture was to blame for the uncomfortable environment. Under Pao’s reign, Reddit tried to eradicate the bro-like amount of alcohol consumption at the office, but that went right out the window following Pao’s departure in July 2015.</p>
<p>&rt;“During all the leadership regimes, <strong>there were multiple incidents where employees would drink too much and end up in embarrassing and inappropriate situations</strong>,” a source explained. “<strong>There were multiple sexual harassment complaints</strong> from both female and male employees against female and male employees stemming from incidents that generally happened when employees were drinking.”</p>
<p>&rt;Several employees fended off uncomfortable comments from users and management alike, sources claimed. “<strong>Management is terrible, a complete reflection of what the site is like</strong>,” one source said.</p>
<p>Also in case your wondering why all the women and minorities leave reddit</p>
<p>&rt;So why can’t Reddit seem to hang on to its employees — particularly women and people of color? The same source who described management issues told us “working at Reddit is kind of like having an abusive boyfriend.”</p>
<p>&rt;&rt;You care deeply for it. You believe in it. You want to make it better. You think you just might be the person that can make that happen. Then one day you realize how hard you have worked to make positive changes only to have it constantly chip away at your sense of self and continue the same toxic behavior no matter what you do.</p>
<p>&rt;&rt;<strong>That toxic behavior, including the disturbing content and harassment commonly found on reddit, targets women on the site and within the company at a far greater rate than men</strong>. Eventually you have to decide if you want to be a part of that. Is it healthy to continue working there? <strong>Many of us have had to seek therapy for PTSD since leaving.</strong> I don’t think anyone realizes or acknowledges the emotional damage that can occur from an environment like that.</p>
<p>&rt;&rt;It’s not surprising to me when women leave.</p>

<p>I assume this is a gradual depreciation; you're going to remove a useful feature every couple months until Reddit is just a blank page.</p>
<p>This has the added advantage that the UI designers will finally have the amount of padding they seem to want.</p>

        <p>I have a suggestion for something you can remove: stemming. Or at least give us the stemming:0 or stemming:no capability. Unfortunately, I have no expectation this will ever happen, despite the fact that it makes search results not match search terms, and has done so for years.</p>

        <p>Generally you'll get exact matches first before any stemmed matches. Also I'm pretty sure you can do exact-term matching (not stemmed) by quoting the term. For example <code>askreddit "running"</code> (to not match "runs")</p>

        <p>Just wanted to add another voice regarding the removal of the timestamp functionality with this update.</p>
<p>The back-end restructuring of the Reddit search solutions have been awesome to watch.  But this appears to be a significant strategic gap.  </p>
<p>Reddit's wealth of information is tightly coupled to the day/week/month's context for many communities, and being able to retrieve content from certain periods is immensely useful to us.  </p>
<p>In our dream scenario, we'd actually love to see <em>increased</em> options on this front - even for end users.</p>
<p>Reddit is home to a quarter million Pokemon GO enthusiasts (and arguably the veritable center of the entire game's global community) over on /r/TheSilphRoad, and we've developed a fantastic culture of analysis and research in our community.</p>
<p>But information changes by the week on our boards.  Being able to search specific keywords in the context of specific time periods would be a game changer for us.  (Something we've had to do via API previously, meaning often only the mod team or our most dedicated researchers were able to do so.)</p>
<p>Please consider adding the ability to use timestamps in a future iteration, and if possible, consider allowing the average Redditor to tap into the historical treasure trove that is timestamp-contextualized searching.</p>
<p>We'd be happy to chat more about this and answer any questions or illustrate use cases further.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Just took a look at the r/changelog announcement post about this and ... 3 of the 5 top comments are requests for greater control over the date ranges of the search parameters. I hope this helps illustrate the relevancy and utility of this. :)</p>

<p>Is there any way to add the ability to filter by id range? It would then be easy enough for us to compute/calculate rough timestamps based on a timestamp/id lookup table on our end, and then still be able to filter. </p>

        <p>Is there actually any way to search for posts older than 1 year and further down than the 1k most recent posts anymore? It's really frustrating to navigate some subs that have regularly releases but timeless content.</p>

        <p>That's a huge shame - I use this feature all the time. Reddit's use as a historical artifact is amazing. Being able to use <code>timestamp:</code> to search by specific dates is great when searching for what people were posting in response to specific events.</p>
<p>Also, you mention searching by "last month" and "last year" - how about the other "last X" options currently available?</p>

        <p>Adding yet another voice as to how not only is this an awful decision due to the wide variety of applications, especially data analysis in my opinion, however, also, I just plain don't understand. How can pushshift, a third party solution, which reflects not only post data but <em>also</em> comment data, for the use of searching, provide date range querying, but not reddit itself?</p>

        <p>From now on, you can ignore the reddit/Prawtimestamps repository, I moved timesearch to its own repo which is where all new updates go. This is mainly so you can simply <code>git clone</code> and <code>git pull</code> to get updates instead of having to fiddle with individual files.</p>
<p>The 503 error means the server was temporarily unavailable so that's no big deal. Just try again soon.</p>
<p>I'm not sure why you're having the "no attribute <code>log</code>" error, it's <a href="https://github.com/voussoir/timesearch/blob/0ec6002cba484ccc3b41e6e047686aae00249c87/timesearch/common.py#L25">definitely there</a>. Sounds like your system might be importing an old version of the files. Can you try recycling all the timesearch code and downloading clean from the repository?</p>

<p>/u/RepostSentinel is a bot I manage that scans for reposts in a subreddit and currently moderates two former defaults and a dozen or so subs over 100k subscribers. <a href="https://github.com/korbendallas-reddit/RepostSentinel/blob/master/RepostSentinel.py">Source code here</a>. The way it imports old submissions from a sub uses the timestamp search week by week.</p>

<li>
<p>I have a script that compiles best of statistics for top comments of the year. <a href="https://github.com/korbendallas-reddit/Best-Of/blob/master/bestof.py">Older version here.</a></p>

<li>
<p>I'm working on a bot that compiles albums of the top 10 comments from photoshopbattles threads per week/month and creates an imgur album to post to a meta sub.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Other scripts are more one time use and probably don't <em>need</em> the timestamp search.</p>

<p>I think we could get around this by using the Database that TheSentinelBot uses and have it log the post data to that, and then just search based on the post timestamp in our local Database and we can just grab the URL from there. If we don't already store the URL for that we can add that, but pretty sure we do.</p>

        <p>This is a really big deal. As far as I know, timestamp based searching has been the only way to get submissions that are past the 1000 post limit in the various listings. Anything that tries uses the praw <a href="http://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_overview/models/subreddit.html#praw.models.Subreddit.submissions">submissions</a> function that takes advantage of this will break.</p>

        <p>Not a moderating tool, but I have a site that allows people to get post from the last 24 hours for subreddits of their choice. Now I’ll have to make multiple calls to iterate through the last posts until I get to the previous 24 hours which is a significant increase in calls. Previously, through time based searches, I could limit the number of calls I needed to make. Maybe the cost of indexing should be weighted against the increase in network traffic?</p>

        <p>Howdy, I just saw this thread and didn't realize that the deprecation of the timestamp search was what was breaking the bot.</p>
<p>I am the developer of the bot that runs /u/changemyview.</p>
<p>We have weekly, monthly, yearly, and all time boards of points awarded. We used the timestamp search to grab the history of comments to parse these boards. Without the timestamp search, we aren't able to accurately populate these boards.</p>

        <p>Not for nothing, but it feels REALLY bad when these issues only get surfaced when a thread like this rolls around. The last search update was god only knows how long ago, and clearly the devs didn't know. </p>
<p>We need a way to submit issues and track the progress. Make it complicated, make it require 4+years old account, make submission only work on Tuesday afternoon... whatever it takes. </p>
<p>I get that it would be a bear to moderate and manage, but you have to ask yourself - how many more things could be logged and improved that you didn't even know where an issue in the first place? </p>

        <p>The problem with /r/bugs is that it's absolutely flooded with posts that are decidedly not bugs, like "I can't log into my account." Reddit admins already seem to have enough trouble sifting through the feedback they receive, so I doubt that most posts on /r/bugs are ever read by an admin. </p>

        <p>Something I've noticed with the new search is that certain characters don't work. Queries with question marks (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/search?q=What%27s+behind+rich+people+pretending+to+be+self-made%3F&amp;restrict_sr=on">example</a>) don't seem to work. Is this an intentional design choice?</p>
<p>I've also noticed that the <code>site</code> parameter doesn't seem to work as expected anymore. For example <a href="https://www.reddit.com/search?q=site%3Ayahoo.com&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=&amp;t=all">this search for <code>site:yahoo.com</code></a> also returns results for other sites that contain <code>yahoo.com</code> in the url. </p>

<p>That URL looks like <code>https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/search?q=What%27s+behind+rich+people+pretending+to+be+self-made?&amp;restrict_sr=on</code> but in HTTP URLs, <code>?</code> is a special character.

        <p>Whether API or HTML request, that's still a URL and question marks need escaping in URLs because they're special characters. Lemme look at this a little to see if something needs fixing (or maybe my understanding of things)..</p>

        <p>As a regular human, I repeated what u/Jakeable was describing--typing a string with a questin mark into the right sidebar search box-- and r2 seems to url-encode the ? correctly<a href="https://i.redd.it/l6o7a4vo82d01.gif">: https://i.redd.it/l6o7a4vo82d01.g</a>if</p>
<p>Jakeable, is that the method you used? maybe mobile web or redesign has the bug? Could you try giving it a go and see if you can figure out the repro steps for the URL you shared above?</p>

        <p>It looks like <code>submissions</code> will have to be deprecated.</p>
<p>/u/priviReddit is anything in the works to enable the possibility to list all submissions for a given subreddit? Without the timestamp specific search it seems there is now no way via Reddit's API other than iterating through all ids to find all submissions for a subreddit.</p>
<p>Third party APIs like pushshift exist to provide this information, but there are people hesitant to rely on third parties for such information.</p>
<p>Finally, I just want to say thanks in advance for providing a heads up about the deprecation. I really appreciate the opportunity to make a proactive change to PRAW, rather than a reactive one.</p>

        <p>In theory it's possible to algorithmically predict posts' id ranges and distribution for a given subreddit over time, but this wouldn't be with any decent amount of certainty and furthermore would be inefficient because the maximum amount of posts that can be queried by id is 100.</p>

<p>Not currently, and actually it seems a little weird to search specifically for spoilers (although I can imagine wanting to search while specifically excluding them). Can you talk more about what you have in mind there?</p>
<p>&rt; specific time frames [...] any plan to re-introduce this</p>
<p>No, not currently. I've heard mention of this "annual best of" use case a couple of times here in this thread. You can still limit searches to "past year" so I don't think I'm fully understanding what use-case is broken</p>

<p>"Past year" is a relative measure, you'll get different results if you click on it mid-December or mid-January. Also, a year later you won't be able to look at the top posts of two years ago, it'll just the results of the current year.</p>
<p>And more importantly, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/7lukut/rmylittlepony_best_of_2017_nomination_thread/drp2zzg/">as can be seen in the linked post</a>, there's a separate search for each <em>month</em>, which wouldn't be possible at all with the new search. And as subreddit activity varies throughout the year, the top posts of less active months would get buried further down in a search for the whole year.</p>

<p>&rt;Can you talk more about what you have in mind there?</p>
<p>Well, to be perfectly honest, it's not something that comes up often, and as a user it probably would never come up, but as a moderator it can be a useful tool.</p>

        <p>&rt; Besides some minor syntax differences, the most notable change is that searches by exact timestamp are no longer supported on the newer system.</p>
<p>...is that why all the guides and comments I've seen on things like finding my oldest post (either in a particular subreddit, or just on reddit as a whole) don't work <em>at all</em> and instead give me zero search results?</p>
<p>Edit: Is it really that odd for me to want to look at some of my older posts/comments? This is the first I'd seen <em>any</em> mention of anything that would explain why so many places would be suggesting a method that doesn't work at all...</p>

        <p>Yo, since we have a thread about searching, I just wanted to ask: Is there a way to limit your searches to subreddits you are subscribed to?</p>
<p>Just a day or two ago, I refreshed the front page. Silly me. Because wiħ the slight delay in it loading the refresh, a post caught my eye. It was an older post, and was removed from the front page as a result. I tried searching for keywords from the topic and trying to narrow it down to individual subreddits I thought it would be in, but to no avail.</p>

        <p>Is there any way to do case-insensitive title searches with the new search stack?</p>
<p>You might say "use all lowercase", but sometimes exact-case gives matches that all-lowercase does not.  For example, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/search?q=title%3AjQuery&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all">this title:jQuery search</a> includes <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/7wqiv4/need_some_help_on_creating_an_online_form_with/">this result with jQuery/JavaScript in the title</a>, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/search?q=title%3Ajquery&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all">this title:jquery search</a> does not.</p>
<p>It seems maybe like if the query term is only punctuation-separated in the title, not fully whitespace separated, then it needs to be exact case.  I can't be sure of the exact rule.</p>
<p>A real case where this is a problem for bots is searching for username mentions in a title, as people may say "u\/username" in a title. A search for "title:privireddit" will match a title containing "priviReddit" or "privireddit" or "u\/privireddit", but not "u\/priviReddit". (A search for "title:priviReddit" will only match titles containing "priviReddit" and "u\/priviReddit", so that's no help.)</p>

        <p>This is not good, in /r/art we use a bot to stop people from spamming multiple posts in an 48 hour time frame, and we use this call to poll the latest few posts and we check those against our database (python + praw):</p>
<pre><code>submissions = reddit.subreddit('art').submissions(start = last_submission_date_timestamp)
</code></pre>
<p>The query returned exactly what was needed, without unnecessary traffic, and I don't even get from this what is replacing this.</p>
<p>I guess we'll just allow the spam and bloat reddit further with unwanted content, that seems to be the goal of this. At least the new search of all this spam will be fast?</p>

        <p>Please notify the owners of bots and applications who this has caused an issue of.</p>
<p>It is clearly evident that you miscalculated the scale of applications that this would affect, and their intersection with the redditdev and changelog communities.</p>
<p>Given the massive amount of analytics you collect, I would think it relatively simple to query all OAuth app ids that have been hitting the /search endpoint and sending the developers an email from api@reddit.com and from /u/reddit. It should be noted it seems that given the comments on this thread, more than just cloudsearch has been affected, so narrowing it down to only cloudsearch users is not enough. Not to mention that email address was specifically noted to be for special api changes, and this is a large one.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it would be nice if you let them know of alternatives they now have, which are</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>hitting a third party API such as pushshift</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hitting /api/info with consecutive ids and yielding results, filtering them as they yield</p>
</li>
